And first 
首先，

I want to explain the name of the Pali language itself. 
我想解释一下“巴利语”这个名称本身。

Because it is quite interesting to know that 
因为要知道，有趣的是，

the name of the Pali language 
巴利语的名称

arose through something of misunderstanding. 
是基于一些误解而产生的。

We don't actually know the original name of the language 
实际上，我们并不知道这种语言的原始名称，

or even whether there was a specific name for this language. 
甚至不知道这种语言是否有一个具体的名称。

But the word Pali within this language 
但“巴利”这个词在这个语言里面的意思是

means a row or a line. 
一行或一条线。

And the word came to be assigned to Buddhist texts 
而这个名称之所以被分配到佛教圣典上，

because the texts were written in lines, lines of words. 
是因为圣典的文字是一行一行地书写的。

Originally the texts were inscribed on Ola leaves
最初的文字是刻在奥拉（Ola）叶上的，

which is a leaf of a kind of palm tree. 
奥拉叶是一种棕榈树的叶子。

And the scribes who would write them would write the characters in lines very elegantly.  
而书写这些文字的抄写员，会把字写得很有线条感。

And so the texts were called Pali. 
因此，这种文本被称为“巴利”。

Then there was a sudden point the distinction came to be made between canonical texts, 
然后，突然之间，就开始进行了如下的区分。

texts that were regarded as the authorized Buddhavacana (word of the Buddha),  
圣典文本认为是佛陀亲口所说的文本。

and the commentaries on these texts. 
另外一个是对圣典的注释文本。

The commentaries were written by generations of Buddhist monks 
注释书是从很早的时期开始，

beginning from a very early period 
由一代又一代的佛教僧侣开始创作的，

who would attempt to explain the meanings of the words, 
他们会试图解释圣典中的字、

phrases and the doctrines contained in them.  
词，以及教义的含义。

At this point the distinction was made. 
这样，圣典和注释书就区分开了。

And the canonical texts were called Pali. 
因此，圣典文本就被称为“巴利”。

And the commentaries were called aṭṭhakathā
而注释书则被称为“义疏”（aṭṭhakathā）。

aṭṭhakathā

So, 
所以，

the Pali or the canonical texts, 
巴利就是指圣典，

the commentaries or the aṭṭhakathā
注释书就是

which means discussion of the meaning, explanation of the meaning. 
对圣典的意义进行讨论和解释。

In the very early period of Buddhist history in Sri Lanka, 
在斯里兰卡佛教史的早期，

the canonical texts were preserved in the ancient Indian language, 
佛教圣典是用古印度语保存的，

in which they were originally transmitted to Sri Lanka, 
这些圣典最初是以古印度语的形式

to the Island of Sri Lanka. 
传到斯里兰卡岛的。

But the commentaries in this early phase 
但是，早期的注释

were written and preserved in the language of Sri Lanka. 
是用古代斯里兰卡的语言写成并保存下来的。

At that time it was the ancestor of the present Sinhala language. 
这种古斯里兰卡语言是现代僧伽罗语的祖先。

That language was called Hela,
这种语言叫赫拉语（Hela），

a early form of Sinhala. 
是僧伽罗语的早期形式。

And so the commentators 
所以论师们

would refer to the language of the canonical texts as Pali bhāsā.
会把圣典的语言称为巴利语（Pali bhāsā）。

I write that down, it's: 
我把它写下来，就是：

p-ā-l-i,

bh-ā-s-ā,

pāli bhāsā

which means the language of the canonical texts. 
巴利语指的是圣典的语言。

It also was called tanti bhāsā,
它也被称为“tanti bhāsā”，

tanti means the transmission,
“tanti”的意思是传承，

the transmitted heritage of the canonical texts. 
也就是传承圣典的遗产。

So tanti bhāsā was the language of the transmitted texts.
因此，“tanti bhāsā”就是传承下来的文本所使用的语言。

But the more frequent expression was pāli bhāsā the language of the canonical texts.  
但是，用“巴利语”指代圣典语言更加常见。

And at a certain point, 
而在某个时候——

I'm not sure whether this understanding developed amongst Asian scholars, 
我不知道这种观点是在亚洲学者、

Asian commentators 
亚洲论师

or early European scholars, 
还是早期的欧洲学者中形成的——

but the phrase pāli bhāsā was misunderstood to mean not the language of canonical texts, 
“巴利语”这个词被误解了，它不再指圣典的语言，

but the Pali language, a language called Pali.  
而是指巴利语，一种名叫巴利语的语言。

And so in this way, 
所以，这样一来，

the language in which the canonical texts was preserved,
传承圣典所使用的语言，

was understood today a language known as Pali 
今天被称为巴利语，

a language called Pali. 
被当做一种语言。

And in this way, Pali came to be known. 
这样，巴利语也就广为人知了。

The word Pali came to be used to designate that language. 
“巴利”这个词也就用来指代这种语言。

Of course in the fifth century, 
当然在五世纪时，

the old commentaries which had been preserved in this early Sinhala language Hela, 
早期僧伽罗语（赫拉语）中保存下来的古代注释书，

were edited and translated into the language of the canonical texts into Pali.  
经过编辑，被翻译成了圣典语言——巴利语。

And from then on, they were preserved in the Pali language.
从此之后，注释书也就以巴利语保存了下来。

And so the distinction between the language of the texts 
于是，圣典和注释书之间的

and the language of the commentaries disappeared. 
语言区别也就消失了。

And so all of the commentaries and sub-commentaries 
所以，后来所有的注释书和复注

have subsequently been written in the language we call Pali. 
都是用我们称之为巴利语的语言写成的。

So there were distinct stylistic differences between the language of the canonical texts and the language of the commentaries. 
 所以，圣典的语言和注释书的语言在风格上有明显的差异。

The language of the canonical texts 
圣典的语言

has a much more distinctly oral flavor to it. 
有更明显的口语味道。

It's clearly a spoken language. 
很明显，它是口头语言。

We can see it in the nuances of the conversation, the dialectical tone of the language. 
我们可以从细微的语言差别、方言的语气中分辨出来。

Or the language of the commentaries is a literary language. 
而注释书的语言则是文学语言。

By the time we get to the ṭīkās or sub-commentaries,
到了复注时代，

it becomes extremely sophisticated, 
语言就变得极其复杂，

extremely refined, literary language, 
变成了极其精炼的文学语言，

using many of the conventions of Sanskrit philosophical literature, 
用了很多梵语哲学文学的习惯用法，

many of the conventions and many of the technical terms of Sanskrit philosophical literature.  
也使用了很多梵文哲学中的专业术语。

In terms of its place in the world family of languages, 
就其在世界语言家族中的地位而言，

it might be something of a surprise to you to know, 
大家可能会感到惊讶，

that Pali belongs to the same broad family of languages that English belongs to. 
从广义上说，巴利语与英语属于同一个语言家族。

That is both English and Pali are very distant cousins within this broad family of languages, which is called the Indo-European languages. 
也就是说，在被称为印欧语系的语言大家族中，
英语和巴利语是非常遥远的表亲。

They both originated from tribes inhabiting the central Asian plains. 
他们都起源于居住在中亚平原的部落。

These tribes moved out in different directions, 
这些部落向着不同的方向迁徙，

one group of tribes spread out westwards 
有一些部落向西扩散出去，

going on to inhabit Europe, moving from across Europe, settling in Greece, Italy,  
居住在欧洲，从欧洲各地迁徙，定居在希腊、意大利，

moving across the Germany, 
穿越德国，

moving across, and then even crossing the English channel and settling in Britain. 
然后甚至横渡英吉利海峡，定居在英国。

Another branch of this group of tribes, 
这些部落的另一个分支，

moved eastwards, 
向东迁徙，

one branch of that settled in Persia, 
其中的一个定居在波斯，

and from that group, from that tribe, the Persian language, old Persian language evolved. 
古波斯语就是从这个部落演变而来。

And still another branch of that community, ancient community, 
而其中的另一个分支，古老的部落，

moved even further eastwards, 
进一步向东迁徙，

crossed over the... 
越过了......

which group of mountains, spread over Pakistan, was now Pakistan, 
横跨巴基斯坦的山脉，就是现在的巴基斯坦，

spread through Afghanistan, 
横跨阿富汗的山脉，

Pakistan, 
巴基斯坦

crossed over the mountains, 
越过这些山脉，

and then entered into what is now India 
然后进入了现在的印度，

and settled in northern India.   
在印度北部定居。

And as their language evolved, it turned into a language which is known as Vedic Sanskrit. 
而随着他们语言的演变，发展出另一种语言，
这就是所谓的吠陀梵语。

These became the settlers, the Aryan settlers of northern India.  
这些人定居下来，成为印度北部的雅利安定居者。

And their language in time became Vedic Sanskrit. 
他们的语言逐渐变演成吠陀梵文。

And so all of the languages 
所以，所有从这种原始语言

which derive from that original language 
衍生出来的语言

are called the Indo-Aryan languages. 
都被称为印度-雅利安语言。

And the original ancestor of that whole family of languages 
而这个语言家族的原始祖先，

is Vedic Sanskrit. 
就是吠陀梵语。

Vedic Sanskrit is called the old or archaic Indo-Aryan language. 
吠陀梵语被称为古印度雅利安语。

Pali belongs to a group of languages called the Middle Indo-Aryan languages, 
巴利语属于一组被称为中古印度-雅利安语的语言，

sometimes abbreviated as MIA,
有时缩写成“MIA”——

Middle Indo-Aryan. 
中古印度-雅利安语。

Ok, as Vedic Sanskrit became an archaic purely literary language,  
好，随着吠陀梵语成为一种古老的纯文学语言，

the common people throughout northern India 
整个印度北部的人们

came to use a variety of dialects  based on Vedic Sanskrit, derived on Vedic Sanskrit, 
开始使用以吠陀梵语为基础的各种方言，

but modified to take on simpler grammatical forms 
它们是在吠陀梵语的基础上衍生出来的，但经过修改，

using different idioms, 
通过各种习惯用法，

simplified in its grammar. 
简化了它的语法形式。

So these were the Prakrits,
这些被称为俗语（Prakrit），

the more natural languages, 
是更自然的语言，

the simplified languages.
是简化语言。

Among these Prakrits were: Magadhi, 
这些俗语包括：摩揭陀语，

the language that was used in the state of Magadha in the time of Buddha. 
它是佛陀时代摩揭陀国的语言。

There would have been Kosala, 
憍赏罗语，

the language used in the state of Kosala. 
它是憍赏罗国使用的语言。

There would have been Paishachi,
派沙奇语（Paishachi），

the language used in the western part of India. 
它是印度西部地区使用的语言。

Ok, so we have a variety of dialects that were used in the different parts of India during the centuries,  we could say from sixth century BC, fifth century BC, fourth century BC. 
好，所以我们可以说，从公元前六世纪、前五世纪、前四世纪
这段时间里，印度的不同地区都在使用各种各样的方言，

These were called the Middle Indo-Aryan languages. 
这些语言被称为中古印度-雅利安语。

Magadhi, 
摩揭陀语

the language of the state of Magadha. 
是摩揭陀国的语言。

Ardha-Magadhi, this is half-Magadhi, 
半摩揭陀语

sort of modified form of Magadhi. 
是摩揭陀语的不同形式。

Kosalan, 
憍赏罗语

the language of the state of Kosala. 
是憍赏罗国的语言。

Perhaps there would have been a language we call
也许还有一种语言，我们称之为

Bengali, 
孟加拉语，

the language used in the region around the Bengal basin 
即在孟加拉盆地周围地区

with the Ganges empties out into the bay of Bangal. 
恒河流向孟加拉湾的地方人们所使用的语言。

That would have been a precursor of the modern Bengali language. 
它应该是现代孟加拉语的前身。

And in Sri Lanka, 
而在斯里兰卡，

the language called Hela 
被称为赫拉的语言

also belongs to the same family of Middle Indo-Aryan languages.   
也属于中古印度-雅利安语系。

These languages are also called Prakrits 
这些语言也被称为俗语，

which means natural languages, 
意思是自然语言，

as opposed to Sanskrit 
与梵文相反，

which means a refined language. 
梵文的意思是雅语——精致的语言。

Ok, now Pali according to contemporary philologists, 
好，根据当代语言学家的说法，

was not actually a spoken language, 
巴利语其实并不是一种口语，

was not a language that was actually used. 
不是一种实际使用的语言。

But it was a synthetic language,
巴利语是一种合成语言，

a language that was created by combining features  of several of the Middle Indo-Aryan languages, 
是将几种中古印度-雅利安语言的特点结合在一起，

to create a kind of universal language, 
从而创造出来的通用语言，

a language that would be comprehensible to Buddhist monks living in a wide range of monasteries scattered throughout northern India. 
它可以被生活在印度北部大多数寺院中的佛教僧侣所理解。

This is a hypothesis, it's not a known fact, 
这只是一种假说，它不是一个已经确定的事实，

but hypothesis according to some modern philologists. 
而是现代一些语言学家提出的假说。

Theravadin Buddhists themselves believe that 
上座部佛教徒认为

Pali was the language spoken by the Buddha. 
巴利语是佛陀所说的语言。

And they identify Pali with Magadhi, the language of the state of Magadha.  
他们认为巴利语是摩揭陀国的语言。

We do not have any actual concrete examples of Magadhi used during Buddha's own time.  
我们没有任何确凿的例子来证明
佛陀在当时所使用的是摩揭陀语。

But we do have edicts put up by king Asoka, 
但是，我们确实发现了，可能是在佛陀之后

perhaps a hundred and fifty or two hundred years after the Buddha. 
可能是150年或200年之后，阿育王所竖立的法敕。

Those are said to be inscribed in the Magadhi that was during king Asoka's time. 
这些据说是在阿育王时期用摩揭陀语书写的。

And from that language we can say that, 
通过这种语言，我们可以说，

from these inscriptions we can say that this language differed in some respects 
从这些法敕中，我们可以看到，这种语言在某些方面

from the language of the Pali Buddhist texts. 
与巴利语圣典中的语言不同。

It's not that the language is very radically different. 
我并不是说，这种语言和巴利语有很大的根本区别。

But there were certain differences in sound values and structure 
但是，在音值和结构上，它们存在一定的差异，

that indicate that the two languages are not identical. 
这说明此二种语言并不完全相同。

They're very similar 
它们非常相似，

but not identical. 
但是并不是同一种语言。

The prevailing hypothesis 
主流的假设是，

is that the earliest Buddhist texts 
最早的佛教圣典

would have been preserved, could have been preserved in a language that was used in the eastern part of India where Buddha lived and taught, 
可能是用佛陀生活和传教的地区——
印度东部地区——所使用的语言保存下来，

perhaps in the old Magadhi itself. 
也许是以古摩揭陀语保存的。

But as the Buddhist texts were transmitted to different parts of India, 
但是，随着佛教圣典流传到印度的不同地区，

they came to be transformed 
这些文本就被转化为

into the language of the different regions. 
不同地区的语言。 

We can't actually say "translated". 
我们也不能说这种转化是“翻译”。

Because these were different dialectical variations 
因为这些只是不同方言的转化，

and pretty much the same language, 
这些方言几乎是同一种语言，

and so was more a matter of transposing the language  from one dialect into another 
所以更多的是把一种方言的语言移植到另一种方言中，

rather than translating it into a completely different language. 
而不是翻译成完全不同的语言。

We might translate a novel written in English into French or into Japanese. 
例如，我们可能会把一本英语小说翻译成法语或日语。

And so the texts came to be preserved and transmitted into variety of dialects 
因此，这些文字被保存下来，并被转化成各种方言，

and then to create a homogeneous language  
然后创造出另一种相同类型的语言，

when that would be intelligible to monks living in different regions.  
让生活在不同地区的僧侣都能听懂。

This language called Pali was created. 
这样，巴利语就被创造出来了。

And the features of Pali as said to be 
大家认为，巴利语

predominately those of the western region of India. 
主要具有印度西部地区的特点。

And so as the hypothesis is put forth 
因此，有人提出这样的假设：

that Pali was probably used basically by monks living in the western region of India. 
巴利语可能基本上是由
生活在印度西部地区的僧侣使用的。

But it included some eastern features 
但是，它也包含了一些印度东部的特点，

to make it intelligible to monks living in the eastern parts of India.     
这样，生活在印度东部地区的僧侣也能够理解。

I read a passage from a book by Oskar von Hinüber 
 我从梵·希努贝的一本书中读到一段话，

who is formerly the editor of the Critical Pali Dictionary 
他曾经编撰过《精审巴利语辞典》，

he is a leading philological Pali scholar in Germany. 
是德国著名的巴利语学者。

And this book is called A Handbook of Pali Literature. 
他的这本书名字是《巴利文学手册》。

He says, 
他说：

"Pali has never been a spoken language 
“巴利语从来就不是一种口语，

neither in Magadha nor elsewhere. 
无论是在摩揭陀还是在其他地方。

For it is possible to infer from linguistic peculiarities of this language 
因为从巴利语的语言特点可以推断，

that it has been created as some kind of lingua franca  (that is a universal language) 
这种语言是作为某种通用语言被创造出来的，

presumably used in a large area at a time considerably later than the time of the Buddha. 
大概是在比佛陀时代晚得多的时候，才被大范围地使用。

The evidence, on which these conclusions are based, are the inscriptions of King Asoka  (3rd century BC), 
这些结论所依据的证据是阿育王（公元前3世纪）的铭文，

which allow us to draw a very rough linguistic map of northern India. 
这使我们能够大致地绘制出一幅印度北部语言地图。

This map shows that Pali is rooted in a language spoken in western India far away from the home land of Buddhism. 
这幅地图表明，巴利语植根于
远离佛教故乡的西印度的一种语言。

At the same time certain eastern features embedded in Pali 
同时，巴利语中所体现的某些东方特征

point to the fact that the texts 
表明巴利语的圣典

have been recast from an earlier eastern version 
是由早期的东方版本经过重铸，

into their present western linguistic shape. 
形成现在的西方语言形式。

Therefore, it is evident that the texts as found in the Theravada Buddhist canon, 
因此，很明显，上座部佛教圣典中所传承下来的文本，

though the oldest Buddhist texts surviving, 
虽然是现存最古老的佛教文本，

are the result of a lengthy and complicated development."  
但却经历了漫长而复杂的发展过程。”

Ok, sometime after the Pali texts were collected, 
好吧，在巴利文文本被收集起来、

and the Pali suttapitaka and probably the early form of the vinayapitaka took shape, 
巴利文《经藏》和《律藏》的
早期某种形式形成后的某个时期，

the rules of classic Sanskrit were formulated.  
经典梵文的规则被制定出来。

And Sanskrit became the predominant language of the intellectual class in India, 
梵文成为印度知识阶层最主要的语言，

the literary and philosophical language. 
是文学和哲学的语言。

And so all the intelligentsia 
于是，所有的知识分子

were expected to know Sanskrit 
都要懂得梵文，

and to use Sanskrit for higher levels of communication. 
并使用梵文进行更高层次的交流。

It was the language of the courtly elites, 
梵文成为了王室精英的语言，

the language of Brahmins,
是婆罗门的语言，

the language of philosophers, poets, dramatists.  
是哲学家、诗人、戏剧家的语言。

And all these had an impact on Buddhist literature as well. 
所有这些也都对佛教文学产生了影响。

Buddhist poets would compose their poems in classic Sanskrit. 
佛教诗人也用经典梵文创作诗歌。

Buddhist philosophers would write their treatises in classic Sanskrit.  
佛教哲学家也用经典梵文著书立说。

The Buddhist Mahayana sutras were written in a form of Sanskrit  
大乘佛教经文是以梵文的形式写成的，

partly influenced by the earlier older Prakrit language. 
部分经文受到了早期较古老的俗语的影响。

And the Pali texts were also subjected to a partial process of Sanskritization. 
而巴利文也经历了部分梵文化的过程。

So that the Pali texts that we have access to now today, 
因此，我们今天所能接触到的巴利文文本，

are probably not identical with the Pali texts that would have been circulating in the third century BC.   
可能与公元前三世纪流传的巴利文文本并不完全相同。

We can observe from these texts  
我们可以从这些文本中观察到

certain features that show 
某些特征，这些特征表明

that had undergone a partial process of Sanskritization. 
巴利语经历了部分梵文化的过程。

For example, 
例如，

we have the word brāhmaṇa we meet in the Pali texts.
我们在巴利文中见到的“brāhmaṇa”这个词。

But this word brāhmaṇa
但是，“brāhmaṇa”这个词

is a Sanskrit word 
是梵语词汇，

which would not correspond to the old Middle Indo-Aryan form of the word, 
并不是中古印度雅利安语的形式，

which could have been something like bhamaṇa
它原来的形式可能是类似于“bhamaṇa”之类的东西。

We have forms of... the grammatical form called the gerund or absolutive 
我们有独立式的语法形式，

which in Pali we have words like: katvā (having done),
在巴利语中，我们有这样的词：katvā（已做），

disvā (having seen),
disvā（已看），

gantvā (having gone),
gantvā（已去），

hantvā (having slain, having killed).
hantvā（已杀）。

This tvā ending to indicate the absolutive,
这个“ tvā”的后缀表示独立式，

indicates, demonstrates a process of Sanskritization.  
体现了巴利语的梵文化过程。

Ok, let's take a brief overview of the literature that has been preserved in Pali. 
好，我们来简单介绍一下以巴利语形式保存的文献。

The most important body of literature that has been preserved in Pali 
用巴利语形式保存下来的最重要的文献体系

is of course the Pali canon. 
当然是巴利语圣典了。

The collection of authorized Buddhist scriptures,  the scriptures of Theravada Buddhism 
上座部佛教经文是公认佛经的集合，

which we also called the Pali tipiṭaka, 
也被称为巴利语三藏，

the three compilations or three collections. 
分成三个部分。

The suttapitaka, the collection of the Buddha's discourses 
《经藏》是对佛陀开示的合集，

and the discourses of disciples 
还有佛陀弟子讲法的合集，

which also include some later exegetical works, analytical works 
这也包括一些后期的注释文献，

like the Patisambhida-Magga 
例如《无碍解道》

and the two Niddesas 
和两部《义释》，

as well as the poetical compilations 
以及诗歌合集，

like the dhammapada, suttanipata 
例如《法句经》、《经集》、

and the verses of the elder monks and nuns the Theragāthā and Therīgāthā.  
《长老偈》和《长老尼偈》。

Then we have the vinayapitaka 
然后是《律藏》，

the collection of the discipline, monastic discipline 
也就是寺院规矩的合集，

which lays down the rules, governing the lives of the monks, the bhikkhus and the nuns the bhikkhunis 
它包括各种戒条，涉及到比丘和比丘尼的生活，

and the general regulations governing the life of the sangha,
僧团生活的一般性规则，

ruled regulations governing ordination, 
剃度受戒的规则，

governing the pātimokkha recitation, 
巴帝摩卡诵戒的规则，

governing the vassa the rains retreat,
涉及到雨安居的规则，

governing robes, 
僧袍的规则，

governing food, governing medicines,
食物的规则、药物的规则，

concerned with lodgings.
以及住处的规则。

The third compilation in the tipitaka  
三藏的第三个合集

is called the abhidhamma pitaka. 
是《阿毗达摩藏》。

This is a collection of seven philosophical treatises 
它是包含了七篇哲学论文的集合，

which evidently comes from the somewhat later period  than the oldest parts of suttapitaka and vinayapitaka. 
较之于《经藏》和《律藏》中最古老的部分，
《阿毗达摩藏》显然是更晚期才产生的。

The abhidhamma treatises 
阿毗达摩的论书

are philosophical or psychological treatises 
是对早期佛教的教义

which give a systematic treatment to the doctrinal teachings of early Buddhism, 
进行系统处理，而形成的哲学或心理学论著，

casting or recasting the teachings in the form of a philosophical  psychology or psychological philosophy. 
以哲学或心理哲学的形式塑造或重塑佛教教义。

Ok, then after the tipitaka, 
好，那么在三藏之后……

and many of the books in the tipitaka have this feature of an oral language. 
三藏中的很多内容都具有口头语言的特色。

We have to remember that 
我们要记住，

for 400 years, 300, 400 years, 
三藏文本以口传形式传承了

the tipitaka was preserved through oral transmission. 
三四百年的时间。

So it has the features of an oral body of literature: 
所以它具有口述文学体裁的特点：

a lot of repetition, 
大量的重复，

simple sentence structure, 
简单的句子结构，

minor variations on simple patterns. 
 对简单模式进行小幅度的改变。

The next major stage of Pali literature
巴利文献的下一个主要阶段

is constituted by the atthakathas.
是由义疏（aṭṭhakathā）构成的。

These are the commentaries. 
义疏也被称为注释书。

The commentaries to the books of the canon, the books of the tipitaka. 
它们是对巴利圣典进行评述的著作。

Many of these...the works of the great commentator  Acariya Buddhaghōsa
大多数……伟大的觉音论师的著作，

or at least ascribed to him, 
或者说至少被认为是他著作的，

and considered to have been composed under his supervision under his editorship. 
被认为是在他的监督下编撰的，或者是经过他编辑的。

And the language of the atthakathas is somewhat different from that of the canonical texts. 
注释书的语言和圣典文本的语言多少有所不同。

Here we have the formal literary language 
在注释书中，我们的正式文本语言

somewhat more elegant, 
比较优雅，

certainly more complicated. 
当然更加复杂。

Then we have the ṭīkās which are the sub-commentaries, 
然后就是复注，

which give more refined analysis of the texts, explanations of naughty points 
它是对文本作进一步细致的分析，

arising at the commentaries 
对注释书中的难点进行解释，

and which employed quite sophisticated techniques of philosophical analysis 
采取了非常复杂的哲学分析技巧，

drawing upon techniques of philosophical explanation that were been used  by the Indian philosophical writers at about fifth sixth seventh centuries.  
吸收了公元五六世纪印度
哲学著作者所使用的哲学解释技巧。

Another important body of Pali literature are the Sri Lankan chronicles. 
另一个重要的巴利文文献是斯里兰卡的佛教史书。

The historical chronicles that we call the history of Sri Lanka. 
这些佛教史书，我们称之为斯里兰卡史。

We have the most important of the Dipavamsa, the earliest history of the island. 
最重要的是《岛史》，是斯里兰卡最早的历史著作。

This was followed by the Mahavamsa the great history of the island.  
接着是《大史》，介绍斯里兰卡伟大的历史。

And this was continued in a work called Cūḷavaṃsa, 
而这部历史在一部名为

which continues the history of the island.
《小史》的著作中得到了延续，它延续了前述的历史。

Then we have a large...a number of other vaṃsas 
然后，我们还有大部……一系列的史书，

which give the history of Bodhi tree,
介绍阿耨罗陀补罗菩提树、

the history of the great stupa at Anuradhapura 
佛塔的历史，
